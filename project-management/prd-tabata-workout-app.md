# Product Requirements Document: Tabata Workout App

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will create a tabata workout application designed for intermediate fitness enthusiasts who want structured, time-efficient workout routines. The app will provide 8 predefined tabata workouts with automatic exercise pairing, following the standard tabata protocol of 20 seconds work / 10 seconds rest for 8 rounds per exercise pair. The goal is to deliver a simple, focused workout experience without the complexity of customization or tracking features.

## Goals

1. Provide intermediate fitness users with 8 structured tabata workout options
2. Automate exercise pairing to eliminate decision-making during workouts
3. Implement standard tabata timing (20s work / 10s rest, 8 rounds) with audio/visual cues
4. Track basic workout completion for user motivation
5. Deliver a streamlined workout experience without unnecessary features

## User Stories

1. **As an intermediate fitness enthusiast**, I want to select from 8 predefined tabata workouts so that I can quickly start a structured exercise session without planning.

2. **As a busy fitness user**, I want the app to automatically pair exercises from my chosen workout so that I don't have to think about exercise combinations during my workout.

3. **As a tabata workout participant**, I want clear timing cues (20s work / 10s rest) so that I can focus on exercise execution rather than watching a timer.

4. **As a fitness user**, I want to see which workouts I've completed so that I can feel motivated by my progress.

## Functional Requirements

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Custom exercise creation or modification
- Social features, sharing, or community aspects
- Nutrition tracking or meal planning
- Detailed performance metrics or analytics
- User profiles or personal data collection beyond workout completion
- Integration with fitness devices or wearables
- Video demonstrations or detailed exercise instructions
- Workout scheduling or calendar features
- Multiple user accounts or user management
- Warm-up or cool-down periods (standard tabata format only)
- Difficulty levels or workout modifications

## Design Considerations

- Simple, clean interface focused on workout execution
- Large, easily readable timers and exercise names
- High contrast colors for work/rest periods (e.g., green for work, red for rest)
- Minimal UI elements during workout to reduce distractions
- Clear workout selection screen showing all 8 options
- Progress indicators to show current position in workout

## Technical Considerations

- App should work offline once loaded (no network dependency during workouts)
- Audio cues should be simple beeps and user-controllable
- Timer accuracy is critical for proper tabata protocol
- App should continue running in background during interruptions (calls, app switching) and maintain timer accuracy
- Local storage for tracking workout completion status
- Responsive design for mobile devices (primary platform)
