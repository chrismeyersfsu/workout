# Product Requirements Document: HIIT Workout App

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile-friendly HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workout application that provides structured bodyweight exercise routines. The app solves the problem of users needing quick, effective workouts without equipment, while providing flexibility in workout customization and duration. The primary goal is to deliver an intuitive, timer-based workout experience that keeps users engaged and motivated through varied exercise routines.

## Goals

1. **Accessibility**: Provide equipment-free workouts accessible to intermediate fitness enthusiasts anywhere
2. **Flexibility**: Offer multiple workout durations (10, 15, 20, 30 minutes) to fit various schedules
3. **Customization**: Allow users to create personalized workouts while offering quick-start options
4. **Engagement**: Maintain user motivation through varied exercise selection and progress tracking
5. **Usability**: Deliver a mobile-optimized experience with clear exercise guidance and timing

## User Stories

1. **As an intermediate fitness enthusiast**, I want to quickly start a 20-minute HIIT workout so that I can exercise during my lunch break without spending time planning.

2. **As a busy professional**, I want to select a 10-minute workout when I'm short on time so that I can maintain my fitness routine consistently.

3. **As someone who gets bored easily**, I want to create custom workouts by selecting my preferred exercises so that I stay motivated and engaged.

4. **As a visual learner**, I want to see exercise demonstrations with images/GIFs so that I can perform exercises with proper form.

5. **As a user building a routine**, I want to save my custom workouts and view my workout history so that I can track progress and repeat effective sessions.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Workout Style Selection**: The app must allow users to select their preferred workout style (Tabata or HIIT), which determines the workout duration and timing structure.

2. **Exercise Database**: The app must maintain a comprehensive library of bodyweight exercises categorized by muscle groups (upper body, lower body, core, full body, cardio). The exercise database must be sourced from a markdown file that can be easily edited to add or remove exercises.

3. **Quick-Start Workouts**: The app must provide 10 pre-built HIIT workouts and 10 pre-built Tabata workouts that users can select from and start immediately.

4. **Custom Workout Builder**: The app must allow users to select individual exercises from the database to create personalized workouts.

5. **Intelligent Workout Generation**: The app must automatically generate balanced workouts when users haven't selected enough exercises to fill their chosen workout style's duration.

6. **Timer Functionality**: The app must provide Tabata-style intervals (20 seconds work, 10 seconds rest) for Tabata workouts and longer intervals for HIIT workouts with customizable work/rest periods.

7. **Exercise Display**: The app must continuously display the current exercise name, demonstration image/GIF, and countdown timer on screen during workouts.

8. **Mobile Optimization**: The app must be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices with touch-friendly controls.



11. **Exercise Instructions**: The app must provide brief text instructions alongside visual demonstrations for each exercise.

12. **Workout Navigation**: The app must allow users to pause, resume, skip exercises, and end workouts early.

13. **Audio Countdown Alerts**: The app must provide audio cues for workout timing, including countdown alerts for exercise transitions and interval changes.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Equipment-Based Exercises**: No exercises requiring weights, machines, or equipment
2. **Social Features**: No sharing, following, or community features
3. **Nutrition Tracking**: No meal planning or calorie counting functionality
4. **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed performance metrics or complex progress charts
5. **Video Streaming**: No full-motion video demonstrations (static images/GIFs only)
6. **User Accounts**: No login/registration system in initial version
7. **Offline Sync**: No cloud synchronization across devices
8. **Payment Processing**: No premium features or subscription model

## Design Considerations

- **Mobile-First Design**: Interface must prioritize thumb-friendly navigation and large, clear text
- **High Contrast**: Timer and exercise information must be easily readable during intense activity
- **Minimal Navigation**: Reduce screen changes during workouts to maintain focus
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Current exercise and timer should dominate the screen real estate
- **Quick Access**: Exercise selection and workout starting should require minimal taps
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced customization options should not clutter the main interface

## Technical Considerations

- **Image Optimization**: Compress exercise demonstration images for fast loading
- **Performance**: Ensure smooth timer updates and transitions during high-intensity intervals
- **Browser Compatibility**: Support modern mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- **Responsive Framework**: Consider CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout adaptability
- **Timer Precision**: Implement accurate countdown timers that don't drift over workout duration
